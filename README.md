 Actually, this is only the front end part of the application which shows the interactive UI and implementing all the functionalities.

# What is Dentalcare?

Dentalcare is a web application that assists both dentists and their clients in their everyday tasks, making it easier for them to set up dentist's appointments around every other chore of their own.

Being a dentist is quite stressful, as I know from my aunt. Not only she has to make appoinments with her patients, but sometimes she has to take time to order some moldings from other specialists, or some medicines and machine parts from long-distance providers.

As for the normal people, we all know that no one enjoys a dentist visit, but it is essential for our dental health so we should do it regularly and also plan it beforehand, as it might take several hours of our day.

# Who can use Dentalcare?

As it might already be clear, this web application can be used both by dentists and their clients. Upon registration a user can select its role and based on it, there will be different permissions. The main feature is scheduling tasks and appointments.

# Technologies Used

For this part of the application I have used **React.js** a well known **JavaScript** frontend framework.
